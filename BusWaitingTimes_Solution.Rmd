## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

If you know Latex, you can use it within an Rmarkdown document. For example, to create some fancy math: $e^{i\pi}+1=0$.

**Bus Waiting Time Problem**

This document is going to show results for the Bus Waiting Times questions of Week 2.
Recall, this exercise was as follows:

Suppose times between bus arrivals are distributed as $T~exp(1)$.

1. Suppose we arrive at a bus-stop at some fixed time during the day (say after 10 hours). How long, on average, do we have to wait for a bus? [What if we arrive at a random time each day?] 
2. If we get off one bus and wait for the next one to arrive on the same route, how long, on average, do we have to wait? 
3. Continuing part 1., how long on average was the time between the arrival of the bus we caught and the one before it.
4. What is the expected time between any two buses? 

Note: the mean of an $exp(\lambda)$ random variable is $1/\lambda$.
We will start by defining some global variables. We are assuming that the waiting time between buses is exponentially distributed, with time measured in hours. We embed R code in the document as follows:

```{r globals, include=TRUE}
Lambda<-1   # the parameter of the exponential distribution for waiting times
WhenDoWeArriveAtBusStop<-10 # For part 1 of the question, this is the time at which we arrive at the bus stop
LengthOfDay<-24 # We will assume we are considering a single day of length 24 hours.
HowManySims<-10000 # The number of replicates we will simulate to answer the questions
set.seed(587641) # Remember to set the random number seed
```
You will notice that Rmarkdown is not great at wrapping long lines of Rcode in a pdf if you knit it to a pdf. html works much better.

So now let's write a function to simulate the arrival times of buses at the bus-stop over a single day.
```{r ArrivalTimes}
ArrivalTimes<-function(DayLength,ArrivalRate){
  Time<-0  # initialize the day to start at hour 0
  AllTimes<-NULL  # this will store the arrival times, for now ther eis nothing to store
  Time<-Time+rexp(1,ArrivalRate)  #this is when the first bus arrives
  while (Time<DayLength){
    AllTimes<-cbind(AllTimes,Time)  # store the arrival time
    Time<-Time+rexp(1,ArrivalRate)  # find the time to the next bus
  }
  return (AllTimes)  # return the vector of arrival times
}
```

Test the arrival time function:
```{r Test}
(TodaysTimes<-ArrivalTimes(LengthOfDay,Lambda))   # The outer brackets tell R to output the result
```
Those look ok.

Now simulate a large number of days, and answers each of the questions from class.
We'll start by declaring a bunch of vector variables to store the relevent times.
```{r Variables}
TimeIWaited<-c()#<-NULL # A vector that will store our waiting times
AverageTimesBetweenBuses<-NULL # A vector to store the average time between buses for each day. there's nothing in it at the  moment.
TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus<-NULL # For part 3, this will store the time between the bus I caught...
# and the one before it
TimeBeforeMyBus<-NULL # We will also store the time between my arrival at the bus stop 
# and the last bus that left the stop before I arrived
```

And now the code that does the simulation study.
```{r Simulations}
for (Days in 1:HowManySims){
  # First generate the arrival times for today
  # Note that, for convenience we assume the days are independent of each other
  TodaysTimes<-ArrivalTimes(LengthOfDay,Lambda)

  # For Q1 we assume we arrive at hour 10. How long do we then wait for a bus?
  #which bus is the first to arrive after I get to the stop...
  WhichBusICatch<-min(which(TodaysTimes>WhenDoWeArriveAtBusStop)) 
  # when does it arrive...
  TimeICatchBus<-TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch] 
  # Store the time I waited...
  TimeIWaited<-cbind(TimeIWaited,TimeICatchBus-WhenDoWeArriveAtBusStop)  
  # For Q3 we need the size of the interval between buses for the interval at 
  # which I arrived at the stop. We have to check whether or not there was a bus before the one I caught that day.
  if (WhichBusICatch>1){
    TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus<-cbind(TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus,TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch]-TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch-1])
    TimeBeforeMyBus<-cbind(TimeBeforeMyBus,10-TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch-1])
  }else{
     TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus<-cbind(TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus,TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch]-0)
     TimeBeforeMyBus<-cbind(TimeBeforeMyBus,TodaysTimes[WhichBusICatch]-0)
  }
  
  # For Q2 and Q4(which are just different ways of asking the same thing) we just want the average time between buses
  HowManyArrived<-length(TodaysTimes)
  if (HowManyArrived>1){
    AverageTimesBetweenBuses<-cbind(AverageTimesBetweenBuses,(TodaysTimes[HowManyArrived]-TodaysTimes[1])/(HowManyArrived-1))
  }
}
```

So what have we got? We use R's 'summary' command to get an overview.
```{r SummaryStats}
summary(TimeIWaited[,])   # Q1
summary(AverageTimesBetweenBuses[,]) # Q2 and Q4
summary(TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus[,]) #Q3
```
The first two means (which we need for Q1, Q2 and Q4) are consistent with the times being expo(1) distributed. 
The last mean, which is relevent for Q3, is not consistent with that. We'll see what it is later.

Let's make some plots to see whether the distributions look exponential.
```{r plottinglibraries, eval=TRUE}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2) # a nicer graphics library for R
#library(grid)
library(gridExtra)  # to allow us to arrange our plots in a grid
#install.packages(cowplot)
library(cowplot)
plot1<-qplot(AverageTimesBetweenBuses[1,], geom="histogram",fill=I("black"),col=I("blue"),binwidth=0.025,center=0.05)
# the 'binwidth' and 'center' commands control where there bins are drawn
plot2<-qplot(TimeIWaited[1,],geom="histogram",fill=I("black"),col=I("blue"),binwidth=0.1,center=0.05)
plot3<-qplot(TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus[1,], geom="histogram",fill=I("black"),col=I("blue"),binwidth=0.2,center=0.1)
plot4<-qplot(TimeBeforeMyBus[1,],geom="histogram",fill=I("black"),col=I("blue"),binwidth=0.1,center=0.05)
MyLabels<-c("Q1 - Daily average time between buses","Q2(Q4) - distn of time I waited for my bus","Q3 - distn of time between bus I caught \n                             and the one before","Q3b - distn of time since last bus")
plot_grid(plot1, plot2, plot3,plot4, labels = MyLabels,ncol = 2, align = 'v',label_size = 8)
```


The claim is that the time I wait is ~expo(1), because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, so let's check that using a QQ plot.
```{r ExpoCheck}
NumberOfPoints<-length(TimeIWaited[1,])
Quantiles<-seq(from=0.5/NumberOfPoints,to=1-0.5/NumberOfPoints,1/NumberOfPoints)
qqplot(qexp(Quantiles,rate=Lambda),TimeIWaited[1,],main="Checking for expo(Lambda)")
abline(a=0,b=1,col="red")
```

The plot lands on the diagonal, so it looks like those times are indeed ~expo(Lambda). 
But the interval between the bus I caught and the one before it is NOT distributed as an expo(1), because of size-biased sampling. In fact, it is distributed as expo(1)+expo(1). (Why is that?), which we check below
```{r SizeBiasedCheck}
NumberOfPoints<-length(TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus[1,])
Expo1<-rexp(n=NumberOfPoints,rate=1)
Expo2<-rexp(n=NumberOfPoints,rate=1)
Expo3<-Expo1+Expo2 # this will add the vectors 'pointwise'
qqplot(Expo3,TimeIntervalBeforeMyBus[1,],main="Comparing to expo(Lambda)+expo(Lambda)")
abline(a=0,b=1,col="red")
```

This effect is known as 'size-biased' sampling. It results form the fact that we are more likely to arrive at the bus stop during a large interval (between buses) than during a short interval. Thus, we do not sample intervals 'at random', but instead sample them with a probability that depends upon the size (in this case the sampling prob. is directly proportional to the length of the interval.)

Things I'd like to know:
1. Can Rmarkdown automatically wrap long lines of code when creating the output pdf (or .doc or html)?    
2. Can we get Rmarkdown to supress uninteresting bits of output (e.g. the library warnings)?  [Solved: Use "warning=FALSE" in code-block header]  
3. What does "cowplot"" really stand for?    
4. Why is each element of this list not appearing on a new line/ (Solved: I needed to add 2 spaces to the end of each line)
